My sister called me on New Years Eve, says that she wants to play a game of
cards via the internet with our Brother (in another state). Sure, I say...
google... google... nadda. Plenty of online card games, but all of them know
the rules to the game.

So, stealing some ideas from Scrottie, I made one. Prettied it up a bit with
some Moose and jQuery and such. And Continuity of course :)
